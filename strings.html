        I'm just here 
        pondering my orb, but if you need me too I could have it tell you whether or not 
        a given string is a palendrome if you want. So uhh all you would have to do is 
        just enter the text down there and then I can whisper it into my orb and then it
        would tell us but I should warn you it speaks kinda big and is also kinda scary
        when it talks so its fine if you don't want to. Oh I almost forgot! when you are 
        done entering your text you have to press the period key... but if you don't want
        to have a period at the end thats ok you can just use an underscore and I can
        explain it to the orb they'll be fine with it I think. so anyways yeah you can 
        do that if you want I'll just be sitting here... OH WAIT I SUPER ALMOST FORGOT!
        Ive tried this before and basically the orb doesn't really like filtering out , 
        and - and stuff like that. it only really likes filtering out . and   so just make
        sure that if you use any other symbols or punctuation or whatever that they are all 
        symmetrical even if they arent technically letters. its not my fault, its the orb!
